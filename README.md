# Pāṇḍitya

Graphs person-work and work-work relationships in the [Pandit Prosophographical Database of Indic Texts](https://www.panditproject.org/).

This can be useful both for exploring certain persons or works of interest and for more quickly finding Pandit items in need of improvement.

You can also learn about and navigate to online e-texts through the SETI layer of the project. Right-click on work nodes for this and other options.

# Web app

Currently deployed at https://panditya.info.

See the [about page](https://panditya.info/about) for more info.

# Offline mode

It's also possible to use the backend code locally to produce graph data for use with e.g. [Gephi](https://gephi.org/).
Resulting graphs are created in memory, (optionally) drawn to the screen with `networkx`, and also (optionally) output for Gephi.
This makes it feasible to visualize the entire graph at once, among other things.
